### Overview

This is the repo for my personal website, [robsteilberg.io](https://www.robsteilberg.io/). It is a React-based Gatsby application that establishes a pipe with [roob1090](https://github.com/r00b/roob1090) and renders a live flight tracker for `KDCA` on the homepage.

### Installation

1. `yarn`
2. `yarn dev`
2. `yarn build` for a production build

See the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) for more info.
