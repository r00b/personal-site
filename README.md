# personal-site

### Overview

This is the repo for my personal website, [robsteilberg.io](https://www.robsteilberg.io/). It is a React-based Gatsby application that establishes a pipe with [roob1090](https://github.com/r00b/roob1090) and renders a live flight tracker for `KAUS` on the homepage.

### Installation

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
3. `npm run build && npm run serve` for a production build

See the [Gatsby docs](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) for more info.
